/// The main object which manages creating and receiving gossip about network events from peers, and
/// which provides a sequence of consensused [Block](struct.Block.html)s by applying the PARSEC
/// algorithm. A `Block`'s payload, described by the [Observation](enum.Observation.html) type, is
/// called an "observation" or a "transaction".
///
/// The struct is generic with regards to two type arguments: one that represents a network event,
/// and one that represents a peer ID on the network. This allows the consumer to customise both
/// what constitutes a transaction that can get consensus, and the way peers are identified. The
/// types have to implement [NetworkEvent](trait.NetworkEvent.html) and
/// [SecretId](trait.SecretId.html) traits, respectively.
///
/// The `Parsec` struct exposes two constructors:
///
/// * [from_genesis](struct.Parsec.html#method.from_genesis), if the owning peer is a part of the
/// genesis group, i.e. the initial group of peers that participate in the network startup
/// * [from_existing](struct.Parsec.html#method.from_existing), if the owning peer is trying to
/// join an already functioning network
///
/// Once the peer becomes a full member of the section,
/// [gossip_recipients](struct.Parsec.html#method.gossip_recipients) will start to return potential
/// partners for gossip. In order to initiate gossip exchange with a partner,
/// [create_gossip](struct.Parsec.html#method.create_gossip) should be called.
///
/// Any messages of type [Request](struct.Request.html) or [Response](struct.Response.html)
/// received by the network layer should be passed to
/// [handle_request](struct.Parsec.html#method.handle_request) and
/// [handle_response](struct.Parsec.html#method.handle_response), respectively.
///
/// If the owning peer needs to propose something to be consensused, it has to call the
/// [vote_for](struct.Parsec.html#method.vote_for) method.
///
/// The [poll](struct.Parsec.html#method.poll) method is used to get the observations in the
/// consensused order.
///
/// Most public methods return an error if called after the owning peer has been removed from the
/// section, i.e. a block with payload `Observation::Remove(our_id)` has been made stable.
///
